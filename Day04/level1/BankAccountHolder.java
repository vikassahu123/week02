/* Problem 2: Bank and Account Holders (Association)
Description: Model a relationship where a Bank has Customer objects associated with it. 
A Customer can have multiple bank accounts, and each account is linked to a Bank.
Tasks:
Define a Bank class and a Customer class.
Use an association relationship to show that each customer has an account in a bank.
Implement methods that enable communication, such as openAccount() in the Bank class and viewBalance() in the Customer class.
Goal: Illustrate association by setting up a relationship between customers and the bank.
