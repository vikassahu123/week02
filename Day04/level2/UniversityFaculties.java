/* Problem 2: University with Faculties and Departments (Composition and Aggregation)
Description: Create a University with multiple Faculty members and Department objects. 
Model it so that the University and its Departments are in a composition 
relationship (deleting a university deletes all departments), and the Faculty members 
are in an aggregation relationship (faculty can exist outside of any 
specific department).
Tasks:
Define a University class with Department and Faculty classes.
Demonstrate how deleting a University also deletes its Departments.
Show that Faculty members can exist independently of a Department.
Goal: Understand the differences between composition and aggregation in modeling complex hierarchical relationships.*/
