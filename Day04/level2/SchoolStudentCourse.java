/* Problem 1: School and Students with Courses (Association and Aggregation)
Description: Model a School with multiple Student objects, where each student can enroll in multiple courses, and 
each course can have multiple students.
Tasks:
Define School, Student, and Course classes.
Model an association between Student and Course to show that students can enroll in multiple courses.
Model an aggregation relationship between School and Student.
Demonstrate how a student can view the courses they are enrolled in and how a course can show its enrolled students.
Goal: Practice association by modeling many-to-many relationships between students and courses.*/
